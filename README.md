# rxjs-operators
A collection of simple examples for RxJS operators

## Getting Started
After cloning the repository, install dependencies with `npm install.` Install babel-cli globablly with `npm install -g babel-cli`

## Structure
This project contains one directory for each RxJS operator that this course covers. 
Each directory usually contains just a single file, `index.js`.
To run this file, and test the demo implementation of the operator, just type `babel-node [operatorName]`

## How To Use
Ideally, you are watching the related Udemy course and writing each of these files along with me as I explain them. In that case, this is just a backup in case you get stuck.
Otherwise, you can review the various files in any way you like, and run any of them to get a better idea of how operators work in action.
